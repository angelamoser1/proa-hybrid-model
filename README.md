# proa-hybrid-model
A hybrid model for protein A processes using the general rate model and colloidal isotherm.


The protein A model is intended to be used for simulation of protein A
load-wash-elute processes. The model has been implemented in Python using free
and open source software including [CADET](https://github.com/cadet/CADET-Core)
and [CADET-Process](https://github.com/fau-advanced-separations/CADET-Process).

See the [user guide](/NIIMBL_Protein_A_Model_User_Guide.pdf) for details and
how to get started using the model.
